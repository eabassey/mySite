Container engines have come to stay and they are making the world a better place. Even though there are other alternatives, the docker container engine (DCE) has won the hearts of developers, IT Ops and even business executives. These days, it is easy for someone to equate Containers with Docker, but what kind of problems does docker solve for each of us in all we do?

## The Taste Of Change
---
Software developers have for a long time longed for isolations in their development environments. The python community has virtual environments, the javascript community also have similar with nvm and node-env and more other open source projects trying to provide isolation at the project level when it comes to versions of dependencies. Once you hit the road with multiple projects on your dev box, releasing software and going back to projects you worked on 2 years earlier, you begin to scratch your head because you upgraded your dev box with all the excitements in tech and forgot that your upgraded box can't run your old projects anymore. As a developer, docker is an answer to prayers and I sometimes feel the past me is jealous of my present.
IT Ops have always had issues with software from developers when it comes to deployment. Waaaaw!! The word 'Deployment' is very popular and common these days but lets be frank, it has not been like this always. Deployments were big and something that would either send you to either your nearest clinic or restaurant. Wait! After deployment, how do we even go back to previous deployments? Will it work? Even when it works, we still wait to see some kind of failure somewhere. The developers said it works on their machine but why is it not working for me? The blame game starts!!! When we meet docker after going through a lot of deployment hell, we can't go back.

## The Addiction
---
Docker and all other container technologies have become an integral part of our workflow. It is very easy to live with this kind of addiction and to be honest, it is a good one. From development to automated build to deployment we can work with a desired state configuration file and version it. Aaaah! Why would anyone work without this? And the best part is that everyone of us has all the power of docker not just super powers like Google and Microsoft. Oh dear docker, older software developers wished you were in their time but now that you are in our present, we are body and soul.
